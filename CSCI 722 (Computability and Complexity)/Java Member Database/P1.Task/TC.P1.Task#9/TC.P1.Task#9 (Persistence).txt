One way to keep hashtable data persistent after a Java program stops running is by storing its contents in a SQL database. Instead of losing all member records when the program closes, saving them in a structured database table ensures they can be accessed later. Each key-value pair from the hashtable corresponds to a row in the Membership table, where the id serves as the primary key, and attributes like firstname, lastname, age, and NewYork are stored as columns. This approach allows for efficient organization and quick retrieval of member data.

To implement this, a JDBC connection is used to interact with the database. When a new member is added, an SQL INSERT statement stores the data in the table, ensuring that all records are properly saved. Then, when the program restarts, a SELECT query retrieves the stored data and loads it back into the hashtable, effectively reconstructing the membership database in memory. This method ensures that all membership data remains intact across multiple executions, preventing loss of information while also improving efficiency. Using a database helps prevent duplicate entries, speeds up searches, and keeps everything structured for long-term use.
