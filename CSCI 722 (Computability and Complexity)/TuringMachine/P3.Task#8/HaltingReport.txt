Halting Report for TC.P3.Task#8
(Inputs from TC.P3.Task#6)

1. binary increment
Input: 1011
Halted: true
Explanation: The machine reached a state with no valid transition after writing the final 1 and moving left to the 'done' state.

2. divisible by 3
Input: 1001
Halted: true
Explanation: The machine ended in the 'accept' state after reading all input, and no further transitions existed.

3. infinite 0/1 pattern
Input: _
Halted: false
Explanation: This machine loops infinitely writing alternating 0s and 1s with no halting state. Execution was manually stopped after 1000 steps using a max step limit in the simulator.
