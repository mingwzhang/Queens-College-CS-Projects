# Queens College Computer Science Projects

This repository contains selected projects and assignments completed as part of the Computer Science curriculum at Queens College, City University of New York.

Each folder corresponds to a specific course and includes programming assignments, course projects, and related implementations developed throughout the semester. The contents emphasize applied implementation, system design, and problem-solving rather than lecture notes alone.

## Notes

- Projects reflect academic coursework and may prioritize clarity and correctness over production-level optimization.
- Some folders were updated after course completion to improve organization, documentation, or reproducibility.
- This repository is intended for educational and reference purposes.
